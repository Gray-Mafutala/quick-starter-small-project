## **This is my quick starter kit for small projects**

You can use this repository to ***quickly start a small project*** (HTML, CSS and JS), in order to test an idea quickly or something like that. Basically, it offers a nice little structure of files already in place with a complete *reset stylesheet*, and all you have to do is code :))

**To clone** this repo with Git, just do: `git clone https://github.com/Gray-Mafutala/quick-starter-small-project.git`.


## **Hierarchy and use**

At the root of the project, there is the famous `index.html` that we all know, and `index.js` that I use for the dynamic side of my site and manage the other javascripts files.

The **assets** and **src** folders are described below:
- 📁 **assets** to place images, icons, fonts, and more...
- 📁 **src** to place all css style sheets, and scripts.
	-  📁 **css** already contains the following:
		- `base.css` file which, as the name says, will be used to write a base style for the project, something that will be used throughout the project like CSS variables (colors, fonts), importing fonts from Google Font, etc.
		- `reset.css` file as a *minified* reset stylesheet.
		- `styles.css` file where I define styles for specific classes and/or elements.
	-  📁 **js**: this is where I put all the javascripts files corresponding to each feature of the site.
